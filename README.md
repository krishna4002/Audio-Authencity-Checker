# Audio Authencity Checker
Welcome to the Audio Authenticity Checker repository! This project demonstrates our effort in developing a machine learning model that determines whether an audio file is real or fake.

## About the Project
This project was created collaboratively by three friends passionate about machine learning and audio processing. The goal of this project is to tackle challenges in identifying fake audio, which could be generated through deepfake audio tools. Here we create a webpage where an user give input and check whether an audio is real or fake.

## Technologies Used
### Programming Language:
Python

### Libraries:

NumPy

pandas

librosa

scikit-learn

### Tools:

Jupyter Notebook 

Streamlit

## Future Work

Expand the dataset to include more diverse fake audio samples.

We try to deploy this ML nmodel using Deep Learning.

We try to add a feature by which we can classify the Mimic Voices.
